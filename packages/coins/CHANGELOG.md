### Patch Changes

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 9ed0ce76: - Publishing new coins hooks in `@zoralabs/protocol-deployments`
  - In coins, pulling ISwapRouter from `@zoralabs/shared-contracts`, and updated the shared interface to match the full interface of the ISwapRouter. This new interface is published in `@zoralabs/protocol-deployments`.
  - Removed publishing of the factory addresses directly in the wagmi config of the coins package, as that's inconsistent with the rest of the packages.
  - Updated the `@zoralabs/coins-sdk` to use `@zoralabs/protocol-deployments` for abis and addresses, which significantly reduces the dependency tree of it and has it follow the patterns of the other sdk packages.
- 9ed0ce76: added deployWithHook to the coin factory

### Patch Changes
